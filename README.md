# Linux_Based_Task_Manager
This project provides a GUI made using GTK+ and Glade and allows users to view used system resources as well as set priorities and processor affinities for different processes. It is also my 4th semester project for the course CS2006 Operating Systems.

## Here are some screenshots of what you can expect from the application.
